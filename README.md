# Parsy

A parsing combinator library, originally inspired by [`chumsky`](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky).

It aims to provide a simple yet elegant way to combine small parsers to parse anything from small formats to [full-fledged programming languages](https://github.com/ClementNerma/ReShell).

_Tutorial still in writing_

You can find examples in the [`examples`](examples/) and [`tests`](src/tests/) directories.

You can find a large, real-world example in the [ReShell project](https://github.com/ClementNerma/ReShell/blob/main/crates/parser/src/parser.rs).
