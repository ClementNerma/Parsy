# Parsy (WIP)

Still in early stages of development!

(**TODO**)

Parsy is a parser combinator library for Rust with an intuitive combinative API.

Its API is similar to Chumsky from which is got much inspiration.

Compared to Nom, it will be intuitive to use for some people but is slower even without allocating (benchmarks to do).
